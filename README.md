# utility

## Function

Utility scripts to simplify common CLI actions.

- `backup`: Backup the filesystem to an external location.
- `record`: Record the display and desktop or microphone audio.
- `scot`: Capture the display to clipboard or file.
- `ydl`: Download video or audio media from the internet.

## Status

Scripts are designed for GNU/Linux with *nix portability in mind as per the table below.

| Script      | GNU/Linux | MacOS |
| ----------- | :-------: | :---: |
| backup      | ✓         | -     |
| ydl-plus    | ✓         | ✓     |
| record      | ✓         | x     |
| scot        | ✓         | x     |

- `backup` is a work-in-progress; MacOS testing is required
- `record` desktop audio option recently broke for unknown reasons
