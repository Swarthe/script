## utility

Utility scripts designed for GNU/Linux with *nix portability in mind as per the table below.

| ----------- | :-------: | :---: |
| backup      | ✓         | -     |
| ydl-plus    | ✓         | ✓     |
| record      | ✓         | x     |

- `backup.sh` is a work-in-progress; MacOS testing is required
- `record.sh` desktop audio option recently broke for unknown reasons
